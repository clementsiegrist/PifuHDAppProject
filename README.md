## 3D Reconstruction of Humans with Images

**Author :** *Cl√©ment Siegrist*

Flask-app small html/css presentation of a sample of our work on 3D Reconstruction of Humans with Images. For more details and exemples of our results
and of our work consults the slides of our oral presentation [here](https://github.com/clementsiegrist/app_projet_vision/blob/main/Grand_Projet_Vision_final-compressed.pdf) as well as the web page (to be completed) [here](http://clemsiegia.pythonanywhere.com/) and download an animation realised with Blender and Adobe Mixamo [here](https://github.com/clementsiegrist/app_projet_vision/blob/main/one_anim/Front%20Twist%20Flip.fbx).

You may have to change the path of the images in the html depending on your folders and path architectures. 

You may have to create a __init__.py file in the app_projet_vision root folder.

```
cd Users/../app_project_vision
```

```
python flask_app.py
```
